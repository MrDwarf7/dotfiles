If stow throws an error about a normal file that already exists, instead of deleting that file in the home directory it might be better to re-run stow with the '--adopt' parameter.
This parameter imports existing files into your stow directory, and then creates a symlink.  Unfortunately it won't work on files that are already symlinks, but at least it'll take care of the bulk of it automatically.

Also, assuming the stow directory is under version control you'll be able see differences between your repository, and the files that got adopted.yay -S nvim-treesitter-parsers-git
