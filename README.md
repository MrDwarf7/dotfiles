The dotfiles for both local and remote dev setup


## Cloning the repo

If you're on a fresh install and need the installer, you can run:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules 
```

If you don't have the .gitmodules file denoting the link already run

```sh
git submodule update --init
```


If you DO have the .gitmodules file, but the folder is empty, just run this

```sh
git submodule update
```

otherwise just clone the repo as you normally would.
